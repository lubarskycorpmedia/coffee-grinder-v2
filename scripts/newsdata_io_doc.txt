Pagination
Pagination is the process of breaking down a large set of results into smaller, manageable chunks, known as pages. NewsData.io API supports pagination to allow you to retrieve a large number of articles in smaller chunks.

When you make a request, the default page size is 10 articles per page for free plan and 50 articles per page for paid plans. You can customize the number of articles you get per request.

For example:

Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/latest?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&q=YOUR_QUERY

This request will retrieve 10 articles per page if you are a free user and 50 articles per page for paid plans.

To go to the next page, you need to use next page string given at the bottom of the page


Get URL

https://newsdata.io/api/1/latest?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&q=YOUR-QUERY&page=XXXPPPXXXXXXXXXX

This request will retrieve the next page of the request.

Please note that you can only go to the next page from your current page. In case you want to go back to the previous page, you need to save the "nextPage" variable in your database.

"Please note that the maximum character limit for a single query (q", "qInTitle" and "qInMeta") is 100. If the number of characters exceeds this limit, the API will show error.

Rate Limit
NewsData.io API has a rate limit, which is the number of requests that can be made to the API within a certain time period. The rate limit is in place to ensure that the API is available for all users and to prevent any one user from overloading the system.

The specific rate limit for the API varies depending on the plan you have subscribed to. For example, a free plan may have a lower rate limit than a paid plan.

The API limit you get for different plans is as follows:

Free Plan: 30 credits every 15 minutes.

Paid plans: 1800 credits every 15 minutes.

If you exceed the rate limit for your plan, the API will return a "Rate Limit Exceeded" error and you will not be able to make any further requests until the rate limit resets after 15 minutes.

For detailed understanding visit - Rate Limit of NewsData.io

API credit limit for different plans
NewsData.io API has a credit limit for different subscription plans. The credit limit is a way to control the amount of usage of the API by the users.

The free plan gives access to 200 API credits on a daily basis. The paid plan has an API credit of 20000 per month for Basic plan, 50000 per month for Professional plan and 1000000 per month for Corporate plan.

You can opt any of the subscription plans as per your requirements.
